I am currently PhD student in forest ecology. My subject is the consequences of forest dieback on habitats and resources, and consequently on communities, especially arthropods.
Before that, I have a technical background with professional studies in forestry management and a degree in forestry engineering. 

About my research
======
My research interests lie in understanding the functioning of forest ecosystems and their responses to global change. This includes biotic and abiotic interactions, consequences of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, conservation biology and functional ecology. My current focus is on understanding the consequences of global change (e.g. changing natural disturbance regimes) on temperate forests.
