In this study, we used a wide variety of methods to analyse our communities (across taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions) and describe forest dieback at the landscape scale. For the latter, we used machine learning with training polygons to detect pixels of dead tree crowns, based on infrared colour orthophotographs. see [here]()
