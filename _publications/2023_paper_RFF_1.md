**Abstract:** Salvage logging is performed to limit the sanitary and economic impact of forest declines. In the present literature review, we examine the impact of these cuts on the ecosystem services related to the resilience of forest ecosystems. Salvage logging affects forest species communities by decreasing the share of closed-forest species while promoting that of more open spaces. Dryad species and species that regenerate through seeds are rather disadvantaged. The soil physicochemical characteristics are also affected. A better consideration of environmental factors in management choices is recommended.

Highlights:
Salvage logging adds to the severity of natural disturbances.
Salvage logging negatively affects closed-forest species, to the benefit of open-forest species.
Salavage logging may induce a decrease in resilience of disturbed forest ecosystems.
