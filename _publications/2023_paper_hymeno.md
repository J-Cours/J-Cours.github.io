**Abstract:** i. Forest decline and dieback are growing phenomena worldwide, resulting in severe, large-scale degradation of the canopy. This can profoundly alter forest microclimates and the provision of trophic resources and microhabitats for forest arthropods, especially those dwelling in the canopy.

ii. In 2019, we assessed the effect of oak decline on the community of canopy-dwelling Hymenoptera. We selected 21 oak stands, and 42 plots, located in three forests in France, presenting contrasting levels of decline. Insects were sampled at the canopy level with green multi-funnel and flight-interception traps.

iii. We collected a particularly diverse community of 19,289 insect individuals belonging to 918 taxa, eight larval trophic guilds and five nesting guilds.

iv. Oak decline had no effect on the abundance or richness of the overall community, but significantly reshaped the community assemblages. Decline had contrasting effects depending on the taxa and guilds considered. Parasitoids were more abundant at intermediate levels of decline severity. Taxa depending on ground-related resources and microhabitats were promoted. Saproxylic taxa were more diverse while xylophagous insects were negatively impacted.

v. Reduced leaf area index promoted several guilds, and the diversity of the overall community. While an increasing tree mortality rate enhanced the abundance and diversity of deadwood resources, it had negative impacts on Hymenoptera guilds. Our results suggest that micro-environmental changes at the ground-level due to canopy decline have major cascading effects on the communities of canopy-dwelling Hymenoptera.

vi. Our study highlights the relevance of studying Hymenoptera communities to investigate the outcomes of disturbances on forest biodiversity.
